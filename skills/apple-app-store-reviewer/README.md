# Apple App Store Reviewer

Local-first Agent Skill for auditing Apple-platform apps before submission or after rejection. It combines deterministic checks with evidence-driven manual review and returns one gate: `NOT READY`, `CONDITIONALLY READY`, or `READY FOR SUBMISSION`.

## Goal

The goal is to help the exact release candidate pass App Review on the first submission by finding and removing observable rejection triggers, broken reviewer paths, and evidence gaps before Apple sees the build. Apple makes the final decision, so this is a readiness objective—not an approval guarantee.

It covers:

- source, archive/IPA, entitlements, privacy manifests, metadata, URLs, screenshots, IAP, subscriptions, login, and account deletion;
- AI consent, provider data flows, safety, age rating, advertising, and worst-case output;
- Capacitor 8.5 release configuration, UIScene migration, plugins/privacy, WebView boundaries, and live updates;
- simulator/XCUITest review journeys, reviewer notes, rejection recovery, and appeal evidence.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.11+. Pillow and JSON Schema support are installed from `requirements.txt`; macOS with Xcode is required for complete archive, simulator, signing, and XCUITest checks.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cp assets/review-input.example.json review-input.json
# Fill in release artifact, metadata, screenshot, and feature paths.
python3 scripts/review_app.py \
  --config review-input.json \
  --output-dir review-output
```

For the final release candidate on a controlled Mac:

```bash
python3 scripts/review_app.py \
  --config review-input.json \
  --output-dir review-output \
  --network \
  --strict
```

Paths in `review-input.json` are relative to that file. Reference reviewer credentials by environment-variable name; never store passwords in the config.

## Capacitor 8.5

Capacitor is auto-detected from package/config, native-project, bridge, or final-bundle evidence. The qualified range is `>=8.5.0 <9.0.0`; Capacitor 9 requires a separate baseline refresh.

The review compares three states: production `webDir` and source config, post-sync native config/assets/dependencies, and the exact submitted bundle. Missing config, asset, plugin, privacy, or identity parity prevents `READY FOR SUBMISSION`. Default inspection never executes JS/TS config or mutates the project; trusted CLI evidence must use the project-local CLI in a disposable copy. Framework presence alone is never a Guideline 4.2/4.3 finding.

## Evidence model

- `PASS` requires an observed artifact or runtime path.
- Missing evidence remains `SKIPPED` or `NEEDS_REVIEW`.
- Deterministic violations are separated from heuristics.
- Visual and AI semantic review remain mandatory even when automated checks pass.
- X, Reddit, forums, and vendor claims may trigger tests, but only current Apple authority and direct app evidence can support a blocker.

Start with [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) for the full workflow. Templates live in `assets/`; policy, Capacitor, AI, payment, screenshot, and community guidance live in `references/`.

## Validate the skill

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skill.py .
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
sha256sum -c CHECKSUMS.sha256
```
